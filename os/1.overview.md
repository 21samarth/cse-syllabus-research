1.  **Process Management:**
    
-   **Processes:** A program in execution is called a process. The OS manages processes, including their creation, scheduling, and termination. It provides mechanisms for communication and synchronization between processes.
2.  **Memory Management:**
    
-   **Memory Allocation:** The OS allocates and deallocates memory for processes. It manages both main memory (RAM) and secondary memory (like hard drives).
-   **Virtual Memory:** Techniques like paging and segmentation are used to provide the illusion of a larger memory space than physically available.
3.  **File System:**
    
-   **File Management:** The OS organizes data into files and directories. It provides methods for file creation, reading, writing, and deletion.
-   **File Permissions and Security:** The OS enforces security measures to control access to files and directories.
4.  **Device Management:**
    
-   **Device Drivers:** The OS communicates with hardware devices through device drivers. It manages input/output (I/O) operations efficiently.
5.  **Security and Protection:**
    
-   **User Authentication:** Operating systems often include login systems to verify user identities.
-   **Access Control:** The OS regulates access to resources based on user permissions and roles.
6.  **CPU Scheduling:**
    
-   **Scheduling Algorithms:** The OS decides which process gets to use the CPU and when. Scheduling algorithms optimize for factors like turnaround time and response time.
7.  **Concurrency and Parallelism:**
    
-   **Concurrency:** Multiple processes can run concurrently, and the OS must manage their execution.
-   **Parallelism:** Operating systems may support parallel execution on multi-core systems.
8.  **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
    
-   **Message Passing:** Processes may need to communicate and share data. The OS provides mechanisms like message passing or shared memory.
9.  **Networking:**
    
-   **Network Protocols:** Modern operating systems often include networking capabilities, supporting communication between devices over networks.
10.  **Boot Process:**
    
-   **Bootloader:** The OS initiates the boot process, loading the kernel into memory and initializing system components.
11.  **Error Handling:**
    
-   **Exception Handling:** The OS manages errors and exceptions, preventing them from causing system failures.
12.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    
-   **User Interface:** Some operating systems include graphical interfaces to enhance user interaction.
13.  **System Calls:**
    
-   **API for Applications:** System calls provide an interface for applications to request services from the operating system.
14.  **Shell and Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    
-   **User Interaction:** Operating systems often provide a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
